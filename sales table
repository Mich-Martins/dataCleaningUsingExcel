# Data Cleaning Using Excel/Google_Spreadsheet V.0.1

## Overview

Data cleaning involves correcting or deleting inaccurate, damaged, improperly formatted, duplicate, or insufficient data from a dataset. There are numerous potential for 
data duplication or labeling errors when merging various data sources. For this documentation, i will be using the google spreedsheet for the cleaning and learning process.

## About the Data

This dataset was collected from kenji explain in one of his vlog. you can check out the video if the documentation is not explanatory enough for learning.

## Starting with the dataset

So long the data is in excel as shown below.

**Step I**
- I highlighted the whole data using the ==ctrl A==
- select the home tab and search for the format to select ==autofit column width== and ==autofit row height==

Now the data looks more better in the format below

**Step II**
- From the table, the Client column B in the dataset needs some formatting with the text in bracket. However, it needs to be removed.
- Highlight the Client column, from the home tab, search for ==Find and replace==, then select the ==replace== option to remove the text in bracket by typing (*) in the ==find== input, leave
the ==replace== input blank as we need the text in bracket to be removed.

**Step III**
- From the new formatted Client column B, we need to change the text to lower case, select Column B and right clicke, scrolle down and select ==insert column left/right==
- From the new inserted column (column C), write the function ===LOWER(B2)== then flash fill.
- Select column C by pressing ==ctrl + shift + arrow down== and press ctrl C, from the home tab, locate the ==paste icon== and select ==paste value==.
- Delete column B to make the column C ==new Client column B==

Observing the next column, the text in column C is quite improperly formatted
**Step IV**
- Insert a new column beside Contact column C by clicking on column E, press ==ctrl space== and press ==ctrl shift +==
- From the new column (Column D), use the function ==TRIM(PROPER(C2))== to correct the text. The trim function is to remove spaces while the proper function is to make the first letter 
of each word start with an uppercase then then the rest will be lowercase.
- copy the column and paste as values, Delete column D to make column C the new Contact Column.

- Create a new column F called the Region column.
- Highlight the department column, from the menu ribbon, select the data tab and select ==Text to column==.
- Choose delimiter and click the option for other by putting the underscore delimiter and click finish once the delimiter has been seperated.

**Step VI**

- This is done by highlighting the entire dataset using the ctrl A
- From the Data tab, locate the ==manage duplicate/remove duplicate== option and click ok to confirm.

**Step VII**
This step is to look out for blank cell and fill it up.
- select a blank cell then hightlight the whole dataset using the ctrl A.
- From the home tab, select the ==find and replace== by clicking the ==go to special== option
- From the pop up option, select the blank option and click ok.
- Go to the formula bar and type in NA and click ==ctrl Enter==

**Step VIII**
From the dataset in the profit margin column, we could notice some form of error showing ==#VALUE== in the column and this is due to incorrect answers from the calculation done in the column. 
Therefore, we can correct this error by using the ==iferror function==
- double click on the first value of the profit margin column
- From the formula bar change the calculation using the ===IFERROR(H2/G2,"NA")== 
- Do a flash fill to correct the error down the column.

**Step IX**
Finally format the table.
- Highlight the table by clicking the ctrl A
- From the Home tab, select the ==format Table== option and choose a format of your choice
